# Personal Website

This personal website was created after I learned the basics of ReactJS, CSS and HTML. This was built two months into my first co-op at Intuit, I built this website in my spare time to hone the skills that I have learnt at work.  Currently the website is at version 1.0, a basic website that does not have the correct graphic design, but functionality wise it is almost there. In the next version, I will be aiming to create a more refined and pleasant looking website. 

When I first started this project I barely had any front-end skills. I was mainly having trouble with CSS, I understood the basics but to master it and build a design to specific specifications was difficult at first. Looking back CSS was something I just had to do over and over again to understand CSS selectors and picking the correct attribute to get my desired outcome.
